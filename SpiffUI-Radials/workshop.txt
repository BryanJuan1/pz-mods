description=[/url] for more information on the latest release!
description=
description=Got an idea for a Radial or any features I missed? Let me know!
description=
description=[h2]Included Base Game Fixes[/h2]
description=These are small tweaks to Base Game Actions that help the immersion of these Radials and the game overall.
description=
description=[b]ISFixAction[/b] - (Repair)
description=[list]
description=[*]Added an Animation when doing a Repair Action
description=[/list]
description=[b]ISWearAction[/b] - (Wear Clothes)
description=[list]
description=[*]Fixed the Rules for Equipping Clothes.
description=[*]You can now walk and equip any upper-body pieces of clothing (ie. shirts).
description=[*]Your character now stops walking for lower-body clothes (ie. shoes).
description=[*]This matches how the Unequip Actions works for these items
description=[/list]
description=[b]ISClothingExtraActions[/b] - (Clothing Extra Actions)
description=[list]
description=[*]Fixed the Rules for Clothing Extra Actions similarly to the ISWearAction
description=[*]Added time (Half the Equip Time) to show an Animation
description=[/list]
description=
description=[h2]Controllers[/h2]
description=Press UP on the D-PAD to show the Main SpiffUI Radial!  Accessing options in each submenu is done by pressing "Up" on the D-PAD as well.
description=
description=[b]NOTE:[/b]This will ONLY work if your character is not in or near a car.
description=
description=[h2]Other Features:[/h2]
description=
description=[h3]Quick Actions[/h3]
description=Some Radials have a "Quick Action" that is performed by a quick press of the key; the Radial is shown with a press and hold.  Each available quick action is explained further in the description.  If you set the Radial to "Show on Press" the Quick Action will be disabled.
description=
description=[h3]Amount to Eat/Drink/Craft[/h3]
description=Some actions can be performed on part or all of the items when you use the context menu, and these Radials can too!  A new Radial will appear asking to confirm how much if applicable.
description=
description=You can also specify an amount to always perform by default in the ModOptions.
description=
description=Quick Actions can only be set to an amount and will not ask.
description=
description=[h3]Radial Pages[/h3]
description=The Radials will automatically paginate if enough items or recipes are available.  "Next" and "Previous" buttons will become available when applicable.
description=
description=[h3]Tooltips[/h3]
description=The Tooltips have been ported to show in these Radials for all Recipes, Items, and Repairs. The Tooltips can be disabled, but are recommended.
description=
description=[b]Known issue for the Recipe Tooltip:[/b] I modified this from the default to prevent the lag from having too many items.  One side-effect of this is that sometimes an ingredient will be duplicated or listed in the wrong category.  This ONLY affects the Tooltip, the Recipe works as intended.
description=
description=[h2]Recommended External Mods[/h2]
description=Some Radials have external mod soft requirements listed below.  Each Radial will work without any external mods, however, certain features and apparent usefulness are only available with other mods.
description=[list]
description=[*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2643751872]AutoSmoke[/url] by NoctisFalco[/b]: It is highly recommended that you use have this mod to unlock the full Smoke Radial Menu.  I use AutoSmoke's Actions to include support for the various cigarette mods in Smoke Radial.  Without this mod, you will still be able to smoke cigarettes but will be unable to interact with packs in the Smoke Radial. Either AutoSmoke or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2691602472]AutoSmoke-Stable[/url] can be used.
description=[*]Having AutoSmoke gives support for both [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2026976958]Smoker[/url]  by Nebula[/b] and [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2396329386]More Cigarettes Mod[/url] by Madman_Andre[/b].  Using only ONE of these cigarette mods is recommended as well.
description=[*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1703604612]jigga's Green Fire[/url] by jiggawut[/b]: Honestly, the reason I made the Smoke Craft Radial.  This mod is one of my personal favorites.  Adds items that populates the Smoke Craft Radial.
description=[*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2799848602]SpiffUI - Inventory[/url][/b]: Modified behaviors to show and hide the Inventory Window, and part of SpiffUI!

description=[h2]SpiffUI Configuration[/h2]
description=
description=[url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2169435993]ModOptions[/url] is required for futher configuration, but the mod will function without.
description=If ModOptions is installed (Recommended) SpiffUI will appear as a category.  This is intended to have common configuration across all of SpiffUI, as well as tools to help configure the game to SpiffUI recommendations.
