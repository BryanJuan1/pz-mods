title=Clothing Actions - Radial Menu
description=[h1]Supports B41+. Works in Multiplayer[/h1]
description=[h3]A new save is not required[/h3]
description=
description=A QOL mod for Project Zomboid that displays a Radial Menu for all Extra Clothing Actions that can be performed on currently worn items.  Less fumbling through your Inventory!
description=
description=For example, gives quick access to turn your Hat, put up your Hoodie's Hood, and others!
description=
description=This mod also adds a timer when performing an Extra Clothing Action instead of it being instant.  The time is half of the standard equip time, and actually allows your character to show an equip animation.  To compensate for this (small) added time, you can now walk during these actions.

description=Should work with any other mods that add ExtraClothingOptions to item definitions too.

description=I'm not sure if this will work with controllers as this is not how I play Project Zomboid.  Also, not sure if this will work for other local players (shared screen co-op)
