description=[h2]About SpiffUI[/h2]
description=
description=SpiffUI (pronounced "Spiffy") is an attempt to make the Project Zomboid in-game UI more player-friendly.  The UI currently acts like a windowing system overtop a video game; similar in behavior to the Openbox/Fluxbox windowing system for a Linux Desktop.  This works as the complexity of the game warrants this, but with little tweaks it can be so much better.
description=
description=There will be several independent modules released under the SpiffUI name that each change/add their own features.  This allows me to make modifications to these independently, and allow you, the user, to choose which are active.

description=[h2]About SpiffUI - Inventory[/h2]
description=
description=The goal of this mod is to change the default behavior of the Loot and Player Inventories in how they are displayed. The Inventory/Loot Panel rules should make sense in normal usage, but may take a small adjustment to your playstyle. Try it for yourself and let me know what you think!
description=
description=[b]Features[/b]
description=[list]
description=[*]The Inventory and Loot panels are hidden until the player triggers an interaction.
description=[*]The Inventory is now bound to the "Tab" key by default.  Pressing Tab will open/close both the inventory and loot panels for the player. The panels cannot be closed when open in this way until you press the key again.
description=[*]Bringing the mouse to the top of the screen will show the inventory or loot panel allowing easy access; you can freely switch between which panel is open by moving the mouse.  The panel is automatically hidden after losing mouse focus.
description=[*]Panels are no longer able to be resized horizontally or moved around.  They are instead locked to the top of the screen in the default location, and can only be resized vertically.  The "Close", "Info", "Collapse", and "Pin" buttons are also hidden.
description=[*]Clicking on a world container will show the loot panel and lock it open until the window is interacted with, an external mouse click, or if you walk away changing the loot panel to a blank floor.
description=[*]Option to Hide the "Inventory" button in the left panel.  (I know the keybind, I don't need it)

description=[b]Update v2[/b]
description=[list]
description=[*]Added option to only autohide on External Mouse Click from windows

description=[h3] Controllers [/h3]
description=If playing with a controller the new behavior will not apply and the inventory will behave like Vanilla.
description=
description=[b]NOTE:[/b] I HIGHLY recommend that you run both the "Set SpiffUI Recommended Keybinds" and "Run All SpiffUI Resets" after you first install and start the game!

description=[list]
description=[*] The Dialog Box shown for the SpiffUI options will trigger the game to be unpaused if in-game.
description=[*] Controllers do not gain focus to the Settings Dialog; please use a mouse for now.
description=[*] Initiating a splitscreen game does not move Player 1's Inventory/Loot panels.  This is vanilla behavior, but complicates things as you cannot move these panels with this mod.
