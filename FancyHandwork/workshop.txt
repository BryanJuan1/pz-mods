description=[h2]Usage[/h2]
description=When Attaching or Detaching an item on your Hotbar, you have a chance for the action to automatically be done with your left hand.
description=
description=A modifier key is added as well, which by default is bound to "Left Control".
description=[b]Note:[/b] By default, "Left Control" is the "Aim" key.  I personally do not use the keyboard to aim (its right-click on the mouse anyways) so I disable this keybind.  You are free to rebind the key in options.
description=
description=When you press the Modifier Key and a Hotbar slot, the item slotted there will go into your Secondary Hand.  Example: (Left Control + 2) equips a Hammer to your left hand.
description=
description=Pressing the Modifier and "E" will swap the items in your hands. (Configurable)
description=
description=[h2]Limitations[/h2]
description=The corrected rotations in the Left Hand will take a brief second to "settle" into place.  Additionally, performing another action may reset the Left Hand mask causing the correction to have to be re-applied (it will do so automatically).
description=
description=[h3]Multiplayer[/h3]
description=Animations should sync across multiplayer.  However, there are a few limitations that may result in some brief odd behavior.
description=
description=Custom Animation states are not synced like how built-in states are, and the game seems to change animations on the player outside of what you do in Lua as well.  I sync the animation states required for this mod, but this is separate from how the game handles its own synced animations.  As such, brief de-sync can happen when a player is performing an action.  For example, an equip animation may start with the right hand like normal and quickly change to the left once the custom state syncs.
description=
description=[h2]Compatibility[/h3]
description=Should be compatible with almost everything.  The only incompatibility I found is with the mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2366717227]Swap It[/url].  [b]Note:[/b]"Swap It's" functionality is way better than this mod, so the quick equip to secondary keybinds are not enabled when using both mods due to incompatibilities.
